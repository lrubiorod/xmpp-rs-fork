xmpp-rs
=======

What's this?
------------

A very much WIP set of rust XMPP library with the goals of being type-safe and
well-tested.

- `xmpp-rs` provides a high-level API for the protocol. You shouldn't need to
  know about the protocol to use it.
- `tokio-xmpp` is a lower-level library that handles the XMPP stream(s).
- `xmpp-parsers` parses XML into Rust and back.
- `minidom` is a DOM library quite specific for XMPP
- `jid` is a Jid parsing library.
